# Oh, byte me!
This is a small library I wrote for developing toward embedded systems. It abstracts some of the work when dealing with entities and bit operations.
I've extracted some code I use for development on the ATmega328p, so if you're using the timer on another MCU - make sure the settings are correct
for your needs. 

In reality, I'm just lazy, and want to reuse as much code as I can.

Peace!
